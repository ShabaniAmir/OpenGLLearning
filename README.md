This is a personal project for understanding how to setup a basic OpenGL workflow for use in 3D visualization. For ease in building, all libraries used in this project are included in the `External/` folder.

Since Vulkan is the ideal choice for games and game engines, this project will most likely be used for less complex projects. 

This project would idealy be stored in a private repository, but for resume purposes is left public.

This codebase will be put together by following guides from http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/, but any implementation of this code in future projects (most likely on repositories on my account) will be original unless otherwise noted.
